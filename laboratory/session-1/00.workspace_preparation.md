Workspaces in the laboratory are local to the machines. Please, sit down in the same place every week if you are using a lab PC. The rest of students must allow those ones to gain acces to their workspace.

Instructions for those who want to use the lab PC follow.

Login with your UPVNET user. In your home directory you will find:

- Unit W: your personal drive from UPV.
- Directory ''recursos/GCD-SNA/'' containing Cytoscape, Anaconda and some course related software.

Jupyter-notebook is already installed and accesible from the KDE menu (Desarrollo -> Jupyter Notebook)

# Cytoscape installation

- Open a file browser (Konqueror or Dolphin) and go into `~/recursos/GCD-SNA/Cytoscape_3.9.1`. 
- Double-click the corresponding icon to execute the installator (Cytoscape_3_9_1.sh).
- Cytoscape needs to restart the first time it is open.

# Anaconda installation (optional)
- Open a text console (Konsole or CTRL+Shift+T) and go into `~/recursos/GCD-SNA/Anaconda`.
- Execute the corresponding installation file () and follow the installation script by answering the default option to all questions (except if you consider otherwise under your own responsability).

Launch the applications through the corresponding icons in Desktop, `~/recursos/GCD-SNA`, or from the KDE menu. If Anaconda or Jupyter shortcuts are not available, you can launch `jupyter-notebook` or `anaconda-navigator` from a console.
