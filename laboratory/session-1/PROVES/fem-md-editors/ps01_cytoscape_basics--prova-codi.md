# 0. About Cytoscape

[Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) is an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks and integrating these with any type of attribute data.

`echo "Hello world"`

```
def fp():
  print("Hello World!!!")
fp()
```

# 1. Importing a network

## 1.1. Import Zachary's karate club

Let's start with a simple case: [Zachary's Karate Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club). This was a Karate Club with a sensei (#1) and a 

```
def fp():
  print("Hello World!!!")
fp()
```

club president (#34) that split into two: some people remained with the sensei, and the others created a new club with the club president.

* `File > Import > Network from File ...`
* Select `karate.gml`
* `Layout > Compound Spring Embedder`
* Look at the graph and try to figure out if there is anything special about nodes 1 and 34.
* [**REPORT**] Include in your report this graph plus and a brief paragraph indicating whether nodes 1 and 34 have visually anything special.
* [**REPORT**] The Compound Spring Embedder is an algorithm derived from force-directed graph layour algorithms. Read the Wikipedia page on [force-directed graph drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) and explain in one paragraph, in your own words, how this works.

**Do not use screenshots**; use `File > Export as image`

## 1.2. Import the Star Wars characters network

Open a graph showing characters that appear or are mentioned in the same scene of a Star Wars movie.

* `File > Import > Network from File ...`
* Select `starwars.graphml`
* If asked, select *shared name* for the node identifier column. This will transform node identifiers into a column named "shared name" internally.
* `Layout > Prefuse Force Directed Layout > All nodes > scenes`
* Find a node with degree larger than *D=20*
* [**REPORT**] Include in your report this graph. Indicate which character has degree larger than *D* (right click on blank space -> add text, then right click on the text -> add arrow).
* [**REPORT**] Include a brief commentary of what kinds of characters are represented by nodes with degree larger than *D*

## 1.3. Import US companies co-ownership

Open a graph representing company co-ownership in the US:

* `File > Import > Network from File ...`
* Select `us_companies_ownership.csv`
* Click `OK` (accept default import)
* It might take a couple of minutes to open
* Layout > Edge Weighted Spring Embedder (might take ~10 minutes in some PCs)
* [**REPORT**] Include in your report this graph.
* [**REPORT**] Do you see more than one connected component? What do connected components represent in this graph?
* [**REPORT**] Include a brief commentary on large-degree nodes in this graph, which are they? What do those nodes represent?

Note: you can zoom in and zoom out with the mouse scroll wheel, you can also use the panel on the bottom-right of the screen to navigate the graph.

# 2. How to edit node and edge styles

*You do not need to include anything from this part (part 2) in your report.*

Reload the Karate Club dataset (`karate.gml`).

Now you can play with the "Style" panel (top-left, between "Network" and "Filter"). Here are some ideas.

## 2.1. How to change the style of the entire network

To style the entire networks in different ways:

* Play with predefined styles, e.g. "Minimal", "Curved", or others.

## 2.2. How to name nodes

To include in each node its name:

* In the label property,
* create a "Passthrough mapping"
* for attribute "name"

To remove these names:

* Remove the mapping (trash can icon)

## 2.3. How to change the shape of node

To change the shape of nodes:

* Click onzsdfsdgfsgdsfg XIMO the drawing to the left of "Shape" and choose another shape

## 2.4. How to change edge width

To change the width of edges:

* Click on "Edge" on bottom left (between "Node" and "Network")
* Click on "Width" property
* Mapping Type = Continuous Mapping
* Column = scenes (this will work in the *Star Wars* graph, which has a column with the number of scenes in common)
* Change the "Current Mapping" by double clicking. You should see a window "Continuous Mapping Editor ..."
* Create a mapping that gives a clear visual separation between thin and thick edges, by editing the mapping so that it has a broader range of values

## 2.5. How to add arrows

To add arrows, you need a directed graph such as the company ownership dataset.

* Change the setting of "Target Arrow Shape".

## 2.6. How to change the entire layout

Try some layouts ("Layout" menu)

* Degree Sorted Circle Layout > All nodes
* Edge Weighted Spring Embedded Layout
 * Try this with the Karate Club, look for nodes 1 and 34.
* Prefuse Force Directed Layout

*You do not need to include anything from this part (part 2) in your report.*

# 3. Basic network analysis

## 3.1. Analyze network

Perform basic network analysis. ``Tools > Analyze network``. Consider the network is not directed.

* Load the Karate Club network
* The analysis adds some node attributes
* Look at these node attributes (e.g., find the node with the largest betweenness centrality)
* [**REPORT**] Indicate which are the two nodes with largest betweenness centrality in the Karate Club
* Change the fill color of nodes to be a *continuous mapping* of column *Betweenness Centrality*; choose the colors so that higher betweenness centrality is associated with a darker color.
* [**REPORT**] Include this graph in your report

## 3.2. Plot different distributions

Look at the results from the network analysis (you will need to go to ``View > Show results panel`` -- if it does not show up, try hiding and showing the results panel)

* [**REPORT**] Include two plots with degree distributions in Karate Club and Star Wars
* [**REPORT**] Include two plots with the distribution of shortest path lengths in Karate Club and Star Wars

## 3.3. Style the network

* Load the Star Wars network
* Make the size of the node larger either for nodes with high degree or nodes with high betweenness
* Change the width and color of edges so it depends o the "scenes" attribute of the network (number of scenes in common). More scenes should mean thicker and darker edges.
* [**REPORT**] Include an image of the network from *Star Wars*, styled as indicated above

# 4. Use a Cytoscape App (ClusterMaker2)

Cytoscape has "apps" that can be installed and used.

## 4.1. Install ClusterMaker2

Install ClusterMaker2 (``Apps > App Manager``). You may need to download a jar file from the [releases](https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/clustermaker2) directory of clustermaker2, and then ``Install from file ...`` in the App Manager.

## 4.2. Use ClusterMaker2

Run the [affinity propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_propagation) clustering algorithm in ClusterMaker2 (``Apps > ClusterMaker2 > Affinity Propagation ...``) on the *Star Wars* network.

* Select any temporary folder if prompted
* ClusterMaker2 requires an attribute for the weight: use ``Array source = scenes`` in *Star Wars*
* Once you run it, the network will have a new attribute in the nodes (in the node table you will see an attribute named ``_APCluster``)
* Use the new attribute in the nodes for "Fill color" using a "Discrete mapping" on ``_APCluster.`` You might have to pick the color for each group, just pick a color for the three largest groups.

[**REPORT**] Include in your report an image of the Star Wars network with the three largest clusters in three different colors (the rest of the nodes can be white).

[**REPORT**] Include a brief commentary on what do you see in these clusters, what do you think they represent and why.

## 4.3. Apply to Karate Club

Use ClusterMaker2 on the Karate Club

* Here you MUST run the network analyzer first so you can have "Edge betweenness" as an attribute in edges
* Use "Edge betweenness" as the attribute for the weight (``Array source``)
* Run the module, you should get two groups, led by #1 and #34 . Are they close to the actual way in which this club splitted?

![Karate Club](karate-true-communities.png)

[**REPORT**] Include in your report an image of the Karate Club network with nodes painted according to clusters.

[**REPORT**] Include a brief commentary on what do you see in these clusters, and whether they have some relationship with the way in which the Karate Club actually splitted

# DELIVER (INDIVIDUALLY)

:warning: First of all, read "[delivering your report](../upf/upf-evaluation.md)" on the evaluation guidelines, and check your report against those guidelines before submitting.

Deliver a brief report of at most 4 pages (it can be less!), in PDF format. Organize your report as follows:

* The first section should briefly describe the three networks, including the number of nodes and edges in each one; you can make a table with this.
* Then, you should have one section about the *Karate Club*, one section about *Star Wars*, and one brief section about the *US Companies* network; include in each section the elements marked [**REPORT**] above.

**Please be brief,** you do not need to write too much, specially if you are not going to say anything substantive: your report can be less than four pages. A "brief commentary" means one or two paragraphs.

Your report should end with the following text:

**I hereby declare that all of the text, tables, and figures in this report were produced by myself.**
