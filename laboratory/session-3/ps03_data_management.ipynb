    "## 0.1. Splitting a string and iterating on its parts\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to split a string into pieces, you can use the following. Suppose the variable `genes` contains a comma-separated list such as `CYP17A1, CYP17, P450C17`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gene_list = genes.split(\",\")\n",
    "for gene in gene_list:\n",
    "    gene = gene.strip()\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str.strip()` method removes white space and newlines from the beginning and end of the string, so it's equivalent to `str.lstrip().rstrip()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do this in one line of code, using the `map(f, v)` function, which results of applying function `f` to each element of the list `v`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gene_list = list(map(str.strip, disease[\"Genes\"].split(',')))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2. Producing the intersection and union of lists\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of intersecting two lists in Python, one of the simplest ones is to convert them to sets, and then computing the set intersection using the built-in `&` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def intersection(list1, list2):\n",
    "    return(list(set(list1) & set(list2)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to test if two lists have elements in common, you can check the length of its intersection (there are other ways). Remember the length of a list is obtained with `len()`:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "if len(intersection(list1,list2)) > 0:\n",
    "    ...\n",
