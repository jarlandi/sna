# Social Network Analysys (SNA)

## Practice sessions

## Software requirements

You will need:

* [Cytoscape 3.9](https://cytoscape.org/download.html) or higher
* Python 3.8 or higher with the following Python packages installed:
   * [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
   * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   * [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
   * Jupyter Notebook ([installation instructions](https://jupyter.org/install.html))

   or alternatively, you can use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python package manager for data science which includes all the above Python packages.

## Hardware availability

In the laboratory you can use either a PC from the lab or your own laptop. As is expected that you may need to continue your practice work out of the laboratory, you may want to use your UPV personal disk space (drive W:) to store your ongoing work to be shared between both computers. You will find W mounted on your home directory.

## Practice sessions

The first two sessions we have handout documents dedicated to Cytoscape, a network visualization tool.

The remaining sessions we have Python notebooks. Download the notebooks, open them, and follow the instructions there (some instructions in color are not visible in the GitHub preview).

Each session describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

:bulb: **Read the practice descriptions before the session,** as they can be sometimes long.

## Delivery requirements

The contents to be included in the document for delivering are specified in the handout last section. Deliveries must be submitted trough *Dropbox* (or *Espai compartit*) section of Poliformat site. Due dates are published in the schedule document of the course. No stuff must be delivered during or at the end of the lab session.

Delivered files must be named `session-X.EXTENSION` (where `X` must be the session number, and `EXTENSION` can be `pdf`, `ypynb` (jupyter file), or `md` (markup file), depending on the session requirements. Not following this pattern or delivery deadlines will incur in a significant decrease of the grade.
