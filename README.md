You need some files of this repository to work with (e.g., datasets or jupiter files). The recommended way to download these files is to download the whole repository (the disk ocupation is very low) and keep updated your local version. After the initial publication, the changes in contents may be frequent but minimal or non-significant. In case of major changes that require an update you will be notified by the instructor.
