# Social Network Analysys (SNA)

## Lab sessions

## Software requirements

You will need:

* [Cytoscape 3.8](https://cytoscape.org/download.html) or higher
* Python 3.8 or higher with the following Python packages installed:
   * [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
   * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   * [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
   * Jupyter Notebook ([installation instructions](https://jupyter.org/install.html))
* Or alternatively, you can use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python package manager for data science which includes all the above Python packages.

## Practice sessions

The first two sessions have handout documents dedicated to Cytoscape, a network visualization tool.

The remaining sessions have handouts that are Python notebooks. Download the notebooks, open them, and follow the instructions there (some instructions are in color and are not visible in the preview shown on the GitHub website). 

Each session describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

:bulb: **Read the practice descriptions before the session,** as they can be sometimes long.

At the end of each handout there is a description of what you should deliver.

Each document must be submitted twice to the Drop box (*Espai compartit*) section of Poliformat site:

1. Version 0: To be delivered by the end of its corresponding lab session including the activities carried out during the session. A mid-term submission (don't worry if you did not finish all the activities).
2. Version 1: To be delivered the day before the next session (deadline 23:55 h). All activities are expected to be complete.

Delivered files must be named as: `session-X-v0.EXTENSION` or `session-X-v1.EXTENSION`, respectively, where `X` must be the session number, and `EXTENSION` can be `md` (markup file), `ypynb` (jupyter file), or `pdf`, depending on the session requirements.
