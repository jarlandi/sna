# Social Network Analysys (SNA)

## Lab sessions

## Software requirements

You will need:

* [Cytoscape 3.8](https://cytoscape.org/download.html) or higher
* Python 3.8 or higher with the following Python packages installed:
   * [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
   * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   * [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
   * Jupyter Notebook ([installation instructions](https://jupyter.org/install.html))
* Or alternatively, you can use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python package manager for data science which includes all the above Python packages.

## Hardware availability

In the lab session you can use either a PC from the lab or your own laptop. As is expected that sometimes you may need to continue your practice work out of the laboratori, you will easily access your personal *W* drive from the lab PC to store your ongoing work.

## Practice sessions

The first two sessions have handout documents dedicated to Cytoscape, a network visualization tool.

The remaining sessions have handouts that are Python notebooks. Download the notebooks, open them, and follow the instructions there (some instructions are in color and are not visible in the preview shown on the GitHub website). 

Each session describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

:bulb: **Read the practice descriptions before the session,** as they can be sometimes long.

## Delivery requirements

The contents to be included in the document for delivering are specified in the last section of the handout of every session. Each document must be submitted twice to the Drop box (*Espai compartit*) section of Poliformat site:

1. Version 0: To be delivered by the end of its corresponding lab session including the activities carried out during the session. This is intended to be a **mid-term submission**: don't worry if you did not finish all the activities.
2. Version 1: To be delivered the day before the next session (deadline 23:55 h). This is the **final submission** of a session: all activities are expected to be complete.

If you do not upload Version 1, the instructor will understant that Version 0 corresponds to the final submission, and the it will be graded under this premise.

Delivered files must be named as: `session-X-v0.EXTENSION` or `session-X-v1.EXTENSION`, respectively, where `X` must be the session number, and `EXTENSION` can be `pdf`, `ypynb` (jupyter file), or `md` (markup file), depending on the session requirements. Not following this patterns will incur in a significant decrease of the grade.
