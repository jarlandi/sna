In this repository you will find handouts, datasets, and instructions for the Workshop and Practice sessions of the course.

Please read the README file you will find in the `laboratory` directory with important information. 

You need some files of this repository to work with (e.g., datasets or jupiter files). The recommended way to access these files is to download the whole repository (the disk ocupation is very low) and keep updated your local version. After the initial publication, changes in contents will be minimal but possible.

(you can see which files have changed)

Other options to downdload files are:
