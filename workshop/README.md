# Social Network Analysys (SNA)

## Workshop sessions

In this repository you will find the handouts used in the workshop sessions of the course. 

Handouts must not be delivered. The target of these activities is to complement the theory sessions so you can be questioned in the theory test.

Handouts will be published at the beggining of the course, please have them at hand in the classroom sessions.

Solutions will be published after their respective workshop session. Nevertheless, for an effective learning process, it is recommended you try to solve the proposed exercices before glance at the solutions.

The students can ask for doubts to the professor anytime throughout the week. Solutions can be commented in the next workshop session if needed.
